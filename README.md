# Magic Island

#ADD MOCKUP
The aim of this project is to show all the beauty a tourist will find if traveling to Mallorca. I kept the project simple providing information about beaches, places to eat, and things to do. But it can be upgraded easily, and also would feasible have partners and section to book rooms, cars, etc..

## User Experience

### 1. Strategy

Project Goals:

### 2. Scope

The Magic Island website is contained within a single webpage. Users do not have to navigate away to use all the elements included in the website. Elements of the homepage are interactive including buttons that show all the things that are possible to do in Mallorca. The website also has a Google Maps API to provide direction.
There is also some JavaScript and GSAP animations to make the experience more user friendly.

### 3. Structure

The main focus of the structure is to allow users to quickly understand what the website is about. With a navigation bar that represents a sunset, a hero image of a beach, and a small description on the main page is easy for a user to understand the site proposal.
Users are invited to scroll down through a button and the next is nicely fade in in the screen with some general information and after some more specific information.
To finish the website the user can send a message through a form in the case have any doubt.
