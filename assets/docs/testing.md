### HTML

- Ran HTML code through [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
  - Two warnings for "The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources". Deleted both after check they really were not necessary.
  - Warning for about section lacks heading. As this section only contains an image and a short paragraph, a heading is not necessary.
